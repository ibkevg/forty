# The Wedge Product

You might think of the wedge product as analagous to the cross product but in a way that isn't limited to 3 dimensions like the cross product is. This is sometimes referred to as the exterior product.

$$ \vc{a} \times \vc{b} \text{ ... analagous to ... } \vc{a} \wedge \vc{b} $$
