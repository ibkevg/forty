In the US, the usual sequence is:

Undergraduate years 1-2: A broad introductory course using a single book, e.g. Halliday/Resnick. This is often two semesters (1 year) for classical physics, and one semester for "modern physics" which may be a separate book.

Undergraduate years 2-4: Intermediate-level courses using separate textbooks for each subject (e.g. Griffiths for electromagnetism, Symon for mechanics)

Graduate (MS/PhD): Advanced courses using separate textbooks again (e.g. Jackson for electromagnetism, Goldstein for classical mechanics)

Three times through the material, at increasing levels of mathematical sophistication.

Kleppner/Kolenkow is a special case in classical mechanics, sort of intermediate between the books that are usually used in the first two stages above. I think Purcell is similar for electromagnetism, although I haven't used it myself. They're sometimes used for fast-paced introductory courses, at places like MIT.

The usual process of learning physics is to first learn basics from a book such as Resnick, and then learn all this again in more detail from more specialized books. However, if the specialized books (like Kleppner which you already have) are not too difficult for you, you can skip the basics and go directly to the specialized books.
- classical mechanics at 2nd year 
- classical electrodynamics, statistical physics and quantum mechanics at 3rd year
- condensed matter, nuclear physics, particle physics, quantum field theory and general relativity at 4th year

# Introductory Mechanics
Before tackling Kleppner, review Shankar's' "Fundamentals of Physics" book and online course.
Here we are looking at mechanics using Newton's original formulation.

 + From David Morin's home page: "This book (the blue book) is written for a more general audience than Introduction to Classical Mechanics (the red book). The blue-book problems are similar to the one-star and two-star problems in the red book. The red book contains many harder problems and more advanced topics. The blue book can be viewed as a stepping stone to the red book."

# Classical Mechanics
Here, in addition to looking at the Newtonian formulation in greater depth, two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics are introduced: Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.

  + A complaint sometimes seen about the problems in Morin's' book is that their solutions often involve what seem like tricks. He does things like take advantage of symmetry or use small angle approxminations for trig functions, etc. While this can frustrate some, especially those self-studying, it does prepare you to think like a physicist armed with a lot of tools for solving problems.

# Advanced Mechanics
Here the  focus is largely on the geometric concepts underlying classical mechanics, in the language of differential geometry, symplectic geometry, differential forms, and Riemannian manifolds.

Configuration space is a differentiable manifold.

The Lagrangian $$ L(q, \dot{q}) $$ is a real-valued function on the tangent bundle. The generalized coordinate $$ q $$ labels which point in the manifold and the generalized velocities $$ \dot{q} $$ are tangent vectors in the tangent spaces at these points.

The Hamiltonian $$ H(q,p) $$ is a real-valued function on the cotangent bundle. The generalized momenta $$ p $$ are covectors in the cotangent spaces.
